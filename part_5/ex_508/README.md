**Exercise 5.08**

 Look at the CNCF Cloud Native Landscape png (also available as interactive)

Circle the logo of every product / project you've used. It does not have to be in this course. "Used" is defined here as something that you know you were using it. Next use different color to circle those that something we used was depending on, except those already circled. Then create a list with information where they were used. Anything outside of this course context can be labeled as "outside of the course"
For example:

    I used HELM to install Prometheus in part 2.
    I indirectly used Flannel as k3d (through k3s) uses it. But I have no clue how it works.
    I've used Istio outside of the course.

You can follow the indirect use as deep as you want, like in the k3d -> k3s -> flannel example, but use common sense to make the final image meaningful."
