**Exercise 2.09**

 Create a CronJob that generates a new todo every hour to remind you to do 'Read < URL >'.

Where < URL > is a Wikipedia article that was decided by the job randomly. It does not have to be a hyperlink, the user can copy-paste the URL from the todo.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random responds with a redirect to a random Wikipedia page so you can ask it to provide a random article for you to read. TIP: Check location header
