DBaaS (Database as a Service)
Pros:

    Ease of Setup: Minimal initial setup required. The service provider handles the infrastructure
    Maintenance: The provider manages maintenance, updates, and security patches
    Scalability: Easily scalable with a few clicks or API calls
    Availability: Most Cloud Providers offer high availability of their DBaaS in multiple region zones
    Backup: Automated backups and disaster recovery are typically included

Cons:
    Cost: Can become expensive for large-scale deployments or high usage
    Vendor Lock-in: Tied to the service provider, which can complicate migration of the data to another provider
    Limited Customization: Less control over the database configuration and environment

    No vendor lock-in: Easy migration to other service providers that support Kubernetes
    Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other Kubernetes-managed services, e.g. on-premise solutions or with other providers
    Community support: Extensive support by large Kubernetes community

Cons:
    Complex Setup: Requires initial setup effort and knowledge
    Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance, updates, and security patches have to be managed
    Backup: Requires manual setup and management of backup processes
    Scalability: More complex to scale, requires significant configuration
