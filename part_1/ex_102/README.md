*Exercise 1.02*

Create a web server that outputs "Server started in port NNNN" when it is started and deploy it into your Kubernetes cluster. Please make it so that an environment variable PORT can be used to choose that port. You will not have access to the port when it is running in Kubernetes yet. We will configure the access when we get to networking.
